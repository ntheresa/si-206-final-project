Two Days of Powerful Conversations

The symposium, “The Poetics of Passing: Interrogating Self-Fashioning as the Other in Zainichi Cultural Production,” seeks to illuminate “zainichi” as a locus for theorizing the notion of passing. Since Koreans and Japanese represent different ethnic groups that cannot be differentiated racially, rethinking received notions of passing through an in-depth study of zainichi literary and visual narratives can help us further theorize hegemonic discourses on passing, as well as the consequences, effects, means, and strategies of passing (or not passing).

This two-day symposium will consist of four panels with 12 presenters, 4 moderators, and 8 discussants (detailed program here) together with an open discussion forum each day.

Come join us!"

8,How to Have Reasons for Your Values,Lecture / Discussion,12:00,Angell Hall,"In philosophy, we provide arguments for our positions.  So it seems that moral philosophers ought to be in the business of providing arguments for moral and ethical convictions.  But I have elsewhere argued that we should not expect to be able to provide arguments of the kind that philosophers paradigmatically make for our most central, important or fundamental normative convictions.  To put that another way, we cannot reason to our fundamental moral or ethical commitments.  However, as I have also argued, this should not lead us to conclude that we could not have reasons for such commitments.  In this paper I attempt to make some progress towards a positive characterization of what it means to have reasons for an attitude that we cannot reason to by considering how we ideally come to adopt or acquire our normative convictions.  I will argue that, while we cannot be argued into fundamental normative commitments, we can be educated into them.  Moreover, what distinguishes such an education from mere conditioning is sensitivity to the reasons or rational grounds for the commitments."

12,Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations,Meeting,13:30,Angell Hall,"We write to invite you to a reading group on Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations. This group will not require preparation prior to the meetings. The format of the reading group will be a slow but deep dive into the Investigations by reading aloud and then discussing the book, section by section. We hope to make it through 5 to 10 sections each meeting. After the discussion on a section dries up, we’ll move to the next section until the hour and a half of the meeting is over. This design is meant to accommodate busy schedules, and it also should be amenable to varying degrees of familiarity with the Investigations and Wittgenstein’s other work.

Our first meeting will be next Friday (February 2) from 1:30-3:00pm. Location: Angell Hall 3184. All interested faculty, staff, and graduate students are welcome to attend. RSVP to Bryan Kim-Butler (bkimbutl@umich.edu) and Ben Mangrum (bmangrum@umich.edu). If you can’t make it for the first meeting but are interested, please let us know and we’ll add you to the mailing list.

We'll bring photocopies of the sections likely to be read and discussed each meeting. However, you’re also welcome to bring your own copy of the Investigations."
13,AE Department Seminar: Apparent Wing Stiffness Using Load Control,Lecture / Discussion,14:00,Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Building,"Apparent Wing Stiffness Using Load Control

Rafael Palacios 
Imperial College 
London

We investigate computational methods for the design of aerostructures in which aerodynamic load control strategies allow for high compliance. This talk will introduce first modelling approaches for coupled aeroelasticity and flight dynamics of very flexible aircraft. A medium-fidelity approach for nonlinear simulation and analysis, based on geometrically-nonlinear beams and unsteady vortex-lattice aerodynamics, will be introduced and exemplified in the study of the dynamics of solar-powered aircraft. Aerodynamic load control will be then demonstrated in two prototypical examples: first, the response of a flexible vehicle in wake-vortex encounter will be investigated using a feedforward strategy for fast response; second, high improvements in the maneuverability of a very flexible flying wing will be demonstrated using predictive control with model updating. The latter is built on an original methodology for a nonlinear model reduction in structural dynamics, which will be finally discussed.

14,Ninth Annual International Graduate Student Workshop | Armenian Childhood(s): Histories and Theories of Childhood and Youth in Armenian Studies,Workshop / Seminar,14:00,Weiser Hall,"For complete workshop program, please visit: https://ii.umich.edu/asp/news-events/all-events/workshops/april-2018--armenian-childhood-s---histories-a.html

In recent years, the study of childhood and youth has gained increasing attention that has resulted in innovative interdisciplinary scholarship. The field of Childhood Studies of the last decade has concentrated on modern childhood(s) and youth, and has questioned the meanings that adults and governmental bodies attribute to children. For example, universal characteristics, such as “innocence,” “incompetence,” and “vulnerability,” defining children and youth have been examined and challenged by scholars from a variety of fields, who insist that “childhood”, like ethnicity, gender, and class, is a constructed social category. Pushing methodological boundaries to explore political, historical, cultural, economic, and social formations, structures and contexts across time and place, scholars have begun to consider children and youth as agents in their political and social environment rather than passive members of society. 
    
   This workshop will initiate an inter-disciplinary conversation about Armenian childhood, children, and youth. The goal is to consider new perspectives, methodologies, and cross-disciplinary frameworks that will put Armenian Studies in conversation with Childhood Studies. We aim to bring together theoretical and methodological approaches along with empirical studies across disciplines that use childhood as a category of analysis and/or concentrate on children’s agencies and experiences in Armenian history, politics, society, economy, and culture. We see both childhood and youth as fluid categories and concepts that are subject to flexible interpretations and definitions.

18,ONCE A FURY: RECORDING  THE SEPARATIST REVOLUTION,Workshop / Seminar,15:30,Angell Hall,"This presentation offers outtakes of interviews with the Furies, a lesbian separatist collective from the early 1970s who published an underground newspaper with a national run. The group formed quickly and ended dramatically, with multiple purges, suspicion of FBI involvement, and numerous interpersonal conflicts—most of which they wrote about in their newspaper. Now, 50 years later, they’re talking—and the IRB-exempt study has turned more problematic with legal and ethical complications of authorship and representation. In this presentation, I offer some insights about the politics of voicing, focusing in particular on the process of attempting to ethically and respectfully listen to and represent other’s stories."

21,Chef & Writer Tunde Wey in Conversation with Rebekah Modrak,Lecture / Discussion,19:00,"Ann Arbor District Library, 343 S. Fifth Ave.","Tunde Wey opened a restaurant in Detroit in 2013. A year later, realizing that the influx of capital to the city was not contributing to an inclusive revival but to the profit of those already “fluent in the language of privilege,” Tunde left the restaurant and moved to New Orleans. He now travels around the country holding dinners, using food as a medium to have conversations about race, equity, and cultural values. Recently, the Nigerian-born chef and writer has received national press for Saartj, his lunch counter in New Orleans where white patrons were asked to pay $30 per plate and people of color were charged $12 per plate as a way to call attention to racial wealth disparity. Participants of color could “opt-in” to receive the profit redistribution. In Ann Arbor, Tunde will host two private dinners for local residents and advocates concerned with equity and race, and will offer food truck conversations for four nights.

At the Ann Arbor District Library, artist and Stamps School Professor Rebekah Modrak (whose works, such as Rethink Shinola, critically intervene in consumption) will moderate a conversation with Tunde about his work as a chef, his decision to use food as provocation, the possibility of transforming consumptive acts through dinners and pop-up restaurants, discriminatory development, racial wealth disparity, and the importance of self-determination in affecting the outcomes of your life and community.  

Tunde’s talk is co-sponsored by the Ann Arbor District Library, The Ginsberg Center for Community Service and Learning, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design."
22,Mountain Heart,Performance,20:00,"The Ark 316 S Main St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104","Mountain Heart offers bluegrass and more. This band as been fearlessly revolutionizing the way acoustic music can be presented and played. The band's name has been synonymous with cutting-edge excellence in bluegrass circles since the group's creation. Widely known throughout the music industry for continually redefining the boundaries of acoustic music, the band has gained legions of loyal fans as a result of both their superlative musicianship and their incendiary live performances. Mountain Heart's music always fell just barely under the bluegrass umbrella, and now, from large outdoor folk music, Americana, jam band, and bluegrass festivals, to sold-out shows opening for Southern rock icons like The Marshall Tucker Band, The Tedeschi Trucks Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Mountain Heart has been making an undeniable connection with wider audiences. Whenever they come to The Ark, they tear the house down—and at the 2018 Ann Arbor Folk Festival, they just had a bigger house to tear down."

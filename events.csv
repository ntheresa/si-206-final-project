18,AE Defense: Design Optimization of Flexible Aircraft Wings Using Tow-Steered Composites,Lecture / Discussion,13:00,Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Building,"Design Optimization of Flexible Aircraft Wings Using Tow-Steered Composites  
Aerospace Engineering PhD Candidate: Tim Brooks, Dissertation Chair: Professor Joaquim Martins

Automatic fiber placement machines have made it viable to manufacture composites where fiber angles vary spatially throughout each layer of the laminate---tow-steered composites. This additional design freedom provided by tow-steered composites have the potential to increase their structural performance relative to their conventional uniaxial fiber counterparts. One area of interest for application of these composites is in the design of flexible wing structures.

High-fidelity aerostructural solvers have been proven effective for accurately capturing the trade-offs between relevant design disciplines for such aircraft. By complementing these solvers with gradient-based numerical optimization, the maximum benefits offered by tow-steered structures can be quantified.

In this thesis, several optimization studies are conducted to compare the performance of conventional and tow-steered composite wings. When minimizing the fuel burn of a Boeing-777-type aircraft, tow steering is found to offer up to 2.3% in fuel savings relative to an optimized conventional composite wing. The trade-off between structural weight and fuel burn performance is then explored through a Pareto front study. In this study, it is found that when wing planform is free to vary, tow-steering offers improvements of up to 1.5% and 1.6% in aircraft fuel burn and structural weight, respectively, depending on the design objective.

The event is always well-attended and a lot of fun (free food, a chance to socialize with faculty and fellow majors). 
 
All undergraduates, faculty, and staff are invited to stop by!  
 

Interested in presenting?

To present in the poster session, a student must have a completed (or almost completed) an advisor-approved independent research project.  Poster sessions are commonly held at scientific conferences; participating in April will allow students to gain valuable professional experience! 
Students who wish to participate in the poster session are expected to design and (professionally) print out a poster that they will present to other students, faculty, and guests at the session.
This is a wonderful opportunity for students pursuing an honors degree to present their research in a public forum, but it is also open to anyone with an approved independent research project!
If you are a student interested in participating, please RSVP (by April 6).
Contact us with questions!

Ruth Chang is currently a Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers University, New Brunswick and will be shortly taking up the Chair in Jurisprudence at Oxford University in Oxford, England where she hopes to create a multi-disciplinary research hub for decision-making and choice. She has a Ph.D. from Balliol College, Oxford and a J.D. from Harvard Law School and has held visiting fellowship positions at Harvard, Stanford, and Princeton. Her expertise concerns philosophical questions relating to the nature of value, value conflict, decision-making, rationality, the exercise of agency, and choice. Her work has been the subject of interviews by various media outlets in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, Taiwan, Australia, Italy, Israel, Brazil, New Zealand, and Austria, and she has been a consultant or lecturer for institutions ranging from video gaming and pharmaceuticals to the CIA and World Bank."
26,The Power of Bias and What To Do About It,Workshop / Seminar,16:30,Taubman Biomedical Science Research Building,"Abstract: Bias includes all distortions of evidence. Multiple biases can affect scientific studies and different biases may be more prevalent in specific disciplines. We have mapped at least 235 biases in the biomedical literature. The lecture will present evidence about the prevalence and magnitude of biases across different fields of investigation. It will also discuss potential solutions that can be used to prevent or minimize the impact of these biases.

Current citation rates: >2,500 new citations per month per Google Scholar, >1,300 new citations per month per Scopus or Web of Knowledge.
Current citation rates suggest that I am among the 20 scientists worldwide who are currently the most commonly cited, perhaps also the currently most-cited physician. This probably only proves that citation metrics are highly unreliable, since I estimate that I have been rejected over 1,000 times in my life. Regardless, I consider myself privileged to have learned and to continue to learn from interactions with students and young scientists (of all ages) from all over the world and I love to be constantly reminded that I know next to nothing."

Fittingly titled ""One Drop of Truth,"" the latest entry in the Wood Brothers' evolution finds three musicians being true to themselves. At a point in their career where most artists would be looking to strategically position themselves for even greater commercial success, they instead turned to artistic expression in service of the muse. In chaotic times when honesty is in short supply and ulterior motives seem to always be at play, The Wood Brothers put faith in themselves and ultimately their audience by writing and recording a collection of songs that is honest and pure. As they sing on the album’s title track: ""Rather die hungry / than feasting on lies / Give me one drop of truth / I cannot deny."" It’s the freest album we’ve done, the most independent album we’ve done, and was the most fun we’ve ever had making a record,"" says brother Oliver Wood. Indeed the album dives headfirst into a deep wellspring of sounds, styles and influences. Whereas their previous outings have often followed a conceptual and sonic through-line, here the long-standing trio featuring brothers Oliver and Chris Wood along with Jano Rix treat each song as if it were its own short film. The plaintive, country-folk of the album’s opening track “River Takes The Town” gives way to the The Band-esque Americana soul of “Happiness Jones.” The wistful ballad “Strange As It Seems” floats on a cloud of stream of consciousness, standing in stark contrast to “Sky High”—a Saturday night barnburner built upon stinging slide guitar funk. “Seasick Emotions” is rife with turmoil, yet “Sparking Wine” is jaunty and carefree. The end result is undeniably The Wood Brothers’ most dynamic recording to date."
